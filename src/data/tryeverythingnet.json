  "overview": "Operation: TryEverythingNet is an experimental image denoising system that combines traditional image processing techniques with deep learning to restore clean images from noisy inputs. The system intelligently tries multiple filtering methods and learns which combinations work best for different noise patterns.",
  "problem": "Image denoising typically requires knowing the noise type in advance. Real-world images often contain multiple types of noise (Gaussian, salt-and-pepper, speckle), making traditional single-filter approaches ineffective.",
  "motivation": "Create an adaptive denoising system that can handle unknown noise types by intelligently combining traditional filters with deep learning, learning from trial-and-error which approaches work best.",
  "dataset": "The dataset included three types of images: JellyFish & Koi Fish, Synthetic, and X-ray. For each noise type, there were approximately 30,000 images, split across three intensity levels (about 10,000 per intensity). For each intensity, we created roughly 5,000 paired samples of clean and noisy images—one clean and one noisey image per pair—used for training and evaluation.",
