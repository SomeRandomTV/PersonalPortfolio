  "overview": "This project demonstrates how to extract hidden periodic patterns from microscope images using frequency-domain (Fourier Transform) analysis. It also corrects for non-uniform illumination to reveal subtle repeating structures.",
  "goals": [
    "Extract the periodic pattern that is (vaguely) visible in the input image.",
    "Remove the impact of non-uniform illumination."
  ],
  "method": [
    "Read the input image from the current directory.",
    "Apply a frequency-domain filter (Fourier Transform) to isolate the dominant periodic components.",
    "Display the frequency-domain filter used for extraction.",
    "Extract and display the periodic pattern.",
    "Correct for non-uniform illumination and display the uniformly illuminated input image."
