  "overview": "Eidos is a custom compiler for my custom Eidos language.",
  "problem": "Parsing structured text is a fundamental computer science problem. Building a parser from scratch provides deep understanding of formal languages, DSA, compilation theory.",
  "motivation": "Understand how compilers work by implementing the frontend stages: lexical analysis and syntax parsing with proper error handling, and later, semantic analysis and code generation.",
  "keyFeatures": [
    "Multi-character token recognition",
    "Whitespace handling",
    "Syntax validation against grammar",
    "Detailed error messages with line numbers",
    "AST generation for semantic analysis",
    "Support for nested structures",
    "Simple IO via print() + read()",
    "Simple arithmetic operations via +, -, *, /, ++",
    "Control flow via for + while loops and if-else statements",
    "Logical Comparisons via <,>, <=, >=, ==, !="
  ],
  "challenges": [
    {
      "challenge": "Efficient token lookahead without backtracking",
      "solution": "Single-character buffer with peek functionality"
    },
    {
      "challenge": "Clear error messages for syntax violations",
      "solution": "Line/column tracking with context-aware error reporting"
    }
