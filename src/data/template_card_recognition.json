  "overview": "A computer vision system for recognizing standard playing cards using template matching. Assumes a black background and standard card designs for robust detection.",
  "goals": [
    "Detect and classify the rank and suit of a playing card from an image or webcam feed.",
    "Handle perspective distortion and varying lighting.",
    "Provide confidence metrics for each detection.",
    "Support both webcam and image upload inputs."
  ],
  "method": [
    "Convert input to grayscale and apply adaptive thresholding.",
    "Detect card contours and apply perspective correction (homography).",
    "Extract and zoom the top-left corner for symbol isolation.",
    "Split corner into rank and suit regions, extract contours, and resize.",
    "Compare extracted symbols to templates using pixel-wise absolute difference.",
    "Classify based on best match and confidence threshold."
