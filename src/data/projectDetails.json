    "overview": "A.R.A. (Adaptive Real-time Assistant) is a privacy-first AI system designed to assist caregivers in monitoring and supporting their care recipients through local-inference machine learning pipelines. Built on top of AXIOM orchestration engine and AuraLens computer vision system, A.R.A. provides real-time assistance without compromising patient privacy. \nNOTE: A.R.A. is still in its earliest stages with research being done on AuraLens and Phase 1 done of AXIOM.",
    "problem": "Traditional caregiver monitoring systems rely on cloud-based processing, raising significant HIPAA compliance concerns and privacy issues. On top of that, Caregivers are left with hours of paperwork to do and not enough 1-on-1 with their recepients. Caregivers need real-time alerts for falls, emotional distress, angerous situations and automated workflows to ease the stress, but existing solutions compromise patient data security and autonomy.",
